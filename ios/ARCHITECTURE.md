# iOS v2 Client Architecture

The iOS v2 client separates wire values, account-scoped state and presentation:

```text
SwiftUI views
        |
        v
Observable session / chat / New Session models
        |
        v
Session repository and projection (session workflows)
        |
        v
Business use-case services
        |
        v
Typed API resources
        |
        v
HTTP and WebSocket transports
```

## Network

`Agents Anywhere/Network` owns URL construction, authentication injection,
JSON transport, multipart upload, raw WebSocket frames, and transport errors.
It does not know sessions, runtimes, or UI state.

## API

`Agents Anywhere/API/V2` maps one method to one Server resource. Request and
response bodies use explicit domain models from `Agents Anywhere/Domain`.
The API layer does not validate user workflows or mutate app state.

The initial resource clients are:

- `V2ProjectAPI`
- `V2ConnectorAPI`
- `V2SessionAPI`
- `V2RuntimeAPI`
- `V2AttachmentAPI`
- `V2RealtimeAPI`

## Business

`Agents Anywhere/Business` composes API calls into user-visible operations:

- `V2DashboardService` loads connector/project/paginated-session resources and opens dashboard
  updates.
- `V2SessionDetailService` hydrates a session, pages timeline history, sends or
  steers messages, interrupts work, changes selections, and recovers events.
- `V2SessionCreationService` validates and creates new sessions, including the
  pre-session inline attachment exception.
- `V2AttachmentService` owns session-scoped upload/download behavior.
- `V2RuntimeInteractionService` owns live catalogs, capabilities, commands,
  and notice responses.

Business services return domain values or throw explicit errors. They do not
own SwiftUI state, caching, navigation, or optimistic timeline reduction.

## State and presentation

`V2ClientServices` owns one normalized server/account/credential lifetime. It
constructs the services, session repository, connectivity monitor and
`NewSessionModel`. `AppState` routes authentication, dashboard updates and app
lifecycle changes into that scope. Signing out invalidates retained observable
models and cancels their outstanding work.

`Repositories` owns coalesced reads, subscriptions, memory/disk caches, authoritative
session projections and event recovery. `Models/Session` exposes stable
`@MainActor @Observable` session, runtime and timeline references for SwiftUI.
The repository publishes local pending sends through the same observation stream
as network updates. Views never own a second session socket or network reducer.

`Models/Chat` adds UI-specific ownership without changing wire DTOs:

- `ComposerDraft` owns text, attachments and composition state. Session and New
  Session drafts remain scoped independently from transient view instances.
- `SessionChatModel` coordinates actual message, attachment, selection and notice
  actions through the existing repository and services.
- `SessionTimelinePresentation` receives repository projections and publishes
  stable rendered rows at 5 Hz. Its idle clock sleeps. Initial/recovered history
  and live token appends have distinct presentation semantics.
- `SessionNoticeStore` owns stable form drafts and response submission state;
  authoritative runtime notices determine blocking and completion.
- `NewSessionModel` calls device/preparation/creation services directly and owns
  the selected device/Agent pair, account-scoped preferences, preflight checks
  and uncertain-creation protection.

`Views/Chat` contains native SwiftUI layouts, the persistent UIKit text editor
bridge, sheet/picker presentation and Textual Markdown rendering. Theme colors
come from the existing `AppTheme`. See [NATIVE_CHAT.md](NATIVE_CHAT.md) for UI
behavior, protocol support, verified checks and manual device validation.

## Projects, startup and device setup

`V2DashboardRepository` is the canonical project/device/session list. Global active,
archived and project lists each own a cursor. A revision fence prevents late HTTP
reads from undoing dashboard pushes or explicit mutations; expanded page membership
survives replacement of the global first page. Counts belong to the server.

`V2RestorationStore` holds the last navigation destination and a profile bound to
the saved server and credential fingerprint. The token stays in Keychain.
`V2LocalStore` serializes versioned, bounded archives off the main actor, with
atomic writes, iOS data protection and backup exclusion. Launch reads local state
before rendering the restored page; profile validation, dashboard refresh and
session recovery run afterwards. Connectivity failures keep that page available.
Only a definitive authentication rejection transitions to signed out.

`DeviceAgentModel` distinguishes available types from configured instances.
`AgentSetupCoordinator` owns pending pairing observations at account scope, so
closing the pairing form cannot cancel discovery. Phone offline/background states
pause its reads; returning online resumes them. Configuration changes use native
controls and refresh instance inventory after uncertain outcomes before retry.

`NewSessionSubmission` stages a local navigation destination and user bubble before
creation. The creation response binds the same client message and attachment
previews to the server ID. The local destination never makes session API requests.
Normal sends stage before upload; accepted, confirmed and uncertain are distinct.
No persisted record is an automatic write outbox.

## Migration boundary

Retired session/runtime API methods, models and the chat placeholder live in
`ios/_deprecated`, outside the application target. The remaining `APIClient`
facade supports the existing shell through `V2ClientServices`; new session and
runtime features use the typed resources and scoped services directly. Do not
restore legacy routes or introduce view-owned transport/cache implementations.
