# Native chat

The native chat replaces the placeholder in the existing authenticated iOS shell.
It uses real session history, runtime capabilities, catalogs, attachments and
interaction responses. Authentication, account management, device management and
the sidebar retain their existing routes.

The implementation builds on the v2 API alignment at `95693c24` and the approved
local Untitled Project prototype at `b7ece2a`. The app uses AA's existing
`AppTheme`: primary controls are black in light mode and white in dark mode.
Semantic error and availability colors remain separate from the primary color.

## Composer and timeline

- The empty, unfocused composer is a pill with the same 48-point base height as
  the header controls and 32-point horizontal insets (eight points narrower on
  each side than before). Focus, any text (including whitespace), or attachments
  expand it. A single `UITextView` survives the layout transition.
- Return always enters a newline or participates in IME candidate selection.
  The send button and Command-Return share the same send path. Marked text blocks
  sending; the client does not force the Chinese input method to commit a guess.
- The editor grows to `min(160, max(72, availableHeight * 0.30))` points, then
  scrolls internally. Controls preserve at least a 44-point touch target.
- The plus button opens a Liquid Glass options sheet with contrasting, borderless
  photo/file tiles and model/permission rows. Secondary selection pages use native
  lists and expand to the large detent. A picker is presented from the persistent
  composer host only after the options sheet finishes dismissing.
- Photo/file imports allow at most five attachments of 25 MiB each. Existing
  sessions upload attachments through the session resource; creation uses the
  backend's inline first-message attachment contract. Downloads are explicit.
- Textual is pinned to 0.5.0 and renders Markdown headings, lists, code, tables,
  quotes, links, images and math. Code copying and native selection remain
  available. Completed Markdown blocks keep their identity and layout.
  Static blocks do not schedule delayed reveal-state changes. The glyph ledger
  stores settled text as a count and allocates birth times only for new glyphs,
  avoiding character-sized allocations when historical text is redrawn.
  The app opts into iPhone ProMotion refresh rates; the system still chooses the
  actual cadence. This is not a measured 120 FPS guarantee.
- `SessionTimelinePresentation` stages received projections separately from
  observable rows. Streamed text waits in that buffer while the previous batch
  reveals; when the reveal ends (240 ms plus one frame) everything received
  since goes on screen as the next batch. Text after a pause shows at once, at
  most one batch animates, and layout lands between animations. Static history
  does not keep a clock awake. New glyphs use a 240 ms opacity, blur and
  vertical reveal. Each batch's glyphs draw as one layer with one blur. A block's
  drawing clock runs at up to 60 fps and only until its newest glyphs finish;
  blocks compare by a digest hashed on the parse worker, not character by
  character on the main actor. Initial history and recovery snapshots do not
  replay reveals.
- Pending user-message removal and authoritative echo insertion happen in the
  same presentation tick. `MarkdownBlockLayout` measures and places each stable
  block with the parent's proposed column width. Its layout-local height cache
  protects asynchronous empty/short fragments without geometry-to-View-state
  feedback. Intrinsic text widths cannot reset the reservation; minimum/ideal
  probes and actual column widths have separate measurements. Real iPad resizing
  reflows immediately, and Dynamic Type/display scale/direction changes reset the
  cache. Authoritative replacements reset the enclosing layout generation.
- Opening a session shows one persistent loading indicator in the detail
  column only for a true cold load, that is, when no in-memory projection
  exists as the page is created. A memory-cached visit presents its snapshot
  during preparation and never shows the full-screen mask. History loading and
  timeline mounting still wait for the sidebar animation's completion and
  another 120 ms; a new selection cancels the pending start. The model
  initializer still does not project cached rows, and a lazy `StateObject`
  lifetime holder prevents parent updates from constructing and discarding
  another chat model. Cached preparation presents the latest 100-record window
  immediately — trimmed exactly like `open()` trims it — and flips readiness
  at presentation; the network refresh (`open`/`loadLatest`) then merges
  through the same stage/flush path without holding readiness or the mask. It
  still reads the repository without requesting history again.
  A sidebar gesture after loading starts does not restart the connection.
  Opening retains only the latest 100 timeline records, including cached visits.
  Older records are loaded explicitly in 100-record pages and accumulate during
  that visit. Reopening trims the window again and preserves the older-history
  flag; recovery updates cannot reinsert rows before its pagination boundary.
  Opening reveals the window when the initial projection is
  ready, and its first return lands at the native bottom edge without an
  animation; every later return (sending, accepted responses, the bottom pill)
  keeps the animated spring. The cold-load mask is dismissed only after that
  first return has settled or a 400 ms fallback expired, so a cold load never
  reveals the top of the window before the opening positioning lands. It never
  pages backward to find a user message. The batch presentation clock still
  does not wait for scroll/layout acknowledgements; there is no frozen opening
  snapshot or positioning retry loop. Network failures still offer Retry.
- `TimelineScrollState` owns three navigation modes: reading, following and
  returning. Opening, sending, accepted responses and the bottom pill all request
  the same return operation. The opening return is marked instant and runs in a
  `disablesAnimations` transaction; it still goes through `begin`/`complete`/
  release and the same drawer-suspension gate, and a reader gesture before it
  was issued leaves later returns animated. Because releasing the position
  clears a pending edge target, the instant return settles on the native end
  marker reporting arrival — or on a bounded 400 ms fallback for content that
  can never report it. SwiftUI resolves the bottom edge in
  its own inset coordinate system; completion releases the target so it cannot
  keep pulling later manual reading back down. Command IDs stop interrupted/old
  completions from releasing a newer target. Layout changes are
  coalesced for 24 ms, and offset callbacks cannot reissue the same target. The
  batched token presentation and the return animation remain independent.
- Two native visibility probes overlap the existing tail spacer. The 2-point end
  marker decides arrival; the 96-point region hides the small borderless “到底部”
  pill before the reader reaches the exact end. The end marker wins if callbacks
  arrive in different orders. Content-size/inset arithmetic cannot override an
  actually visible tail. Explicit opening does not wait for an offscreen marker
  to become visible before issuing its first scroll. The pill stays centered
  above the footer and hides during tracking,
  dragging, deceleration and programmatic scrolling. An interrupted request that
  did not reach its target leaves the pill available instead of endlessly retrying.
- A running SubAgent shows a tinted glass capsule in the same bottom stack, above
  the return pill: one running task shows its name, several show “N 个 SubAgent”,
  and a failed or interrupted SubAgent reds the whole capsule until a newer
  SubAgent is dispatched — the newest batch's failures only, never older ones
  still sitting in the scrollback. Visibility is data-driven — the presented
  Agent call cards, never
  scroll or keyboard state — so it stays up through the keyboard and hides once
  every SubAgent closed. The return pill keeps its existing keyboard-windowed
  hiding, and the stack animates its own slot change on the keyboard event's
  duration and curve so neither capsule jumps while it settles. Tapping the
  capsule opens the SubAgent panel on the first running tab.
- A new vertical gesture cancels automatic navigation immediately. After idle,
  a 64 ms settlement reconciles native phase and visibility callbacks before
  granting auto-follow; stopping nearby remains reading mode. This never holds
  opening behind a spinner. Explicit returns survive old deceleration
  callbacks. Active interactions cancel queued following; a requested return with
  remaining cards finishes in reading mode. Removing the last interaction requests
  the new bottom. Loading older history retains its existing measured anchor.
- The composer and approval dock use one native bottom `safeAreaInset`, which
  owns both the dock's space and the scroll view's visible region. There is no
  measured-height feedback into a second content margin. A constant 32-point
  spacer provides breathing room.
  The phone drawer applies the untransformed host's safe area (including keyboard)
  once, and suspends navigation throughout motion and while obscuring the detail.
  Resuming preserves reading intent and follows new content only when
  appropriate. The phone card uses `SidebarDrawerTranslation.ignoredByLayout()`:
  horizontal movement only changes rendering, including every interpolated
  spring frame. It cannot move the layout origin and vary the column width by a
  physical pixel (observed as 402/402.33 points with two paragraphs changing lines).
  `geometryGroup()` plus a normal offset was insufficient for this case. The
  page keeps rendering, but its untranslated hit targets and accessibility
  elements are inactive while the phone drawer is open or moving. A separate
  screen-space `SidebarDrawerCloseRegion` covers only the exposed main-card strip;
  sidebar taps never reach it. Sidebar controls activate after opening settles,
  and page controls reactivate only after closing settles, not when the spring's
  target first becomes zero. There is no bitmap snapshot, width freeze or gesture
  quantization. iPad keeps its default native split layout and animation.
- Drawer page factories sit above interactive progress, behind a separate view
  boundary for stable safe-area inputs. A pan changes the motion/decoration
  subtree without repeatedly mapping and sorting sidebar data or constructing
  the current page. Real selection, environment and size changes still propagate.
  Sidebar session sections and project lists use lazy stacks for their plain
  text rows. The main conversation keeps its ordinary stacks and measured
  Markdown geometry, avoiding a new estimated-height/scroll-restoration path.
- Both history prompts support a fresh 24-point outward pull and release when
  already visible: pulling past the top loads older messages, and pulling past
  the bottom loads newer records. The prompt changes to “松开加载”; tapping remains
  available. Only one history request runs at a time. Inertia and viewport/content
  resizing cannot trigger a load. A drag during the fetch cancels pending anchor
  restoration or return to the bottom, preserving the user's new reading intent.
  Older history shows an explicit circular spinner through the presentation and
  layout deadline. One measured existing group retains the reading offset when
  a page is prepended, without counting streamed tail growth or aligning a whole
  group to the top. The final page keeps the prompt's height as a start-of-session
  marker, preventing a second jump when loading ends.

## Session presentation and files

- Tools use a single-line, monospaced marker with a disclosure chevron. Commands,
  MCP calls, web searches, Agent calls and file changes follow Web's payload
  parsing. Expanded commands/outputs have bounded scrolling and copying; unified
  diffs include action colors and old/new line numbers. These panels render
  timeline payloads, without fetching file contents. The marker does not parse
  patches or format output JSON: expanding mounts the detail subtree, and
  collapsing unmounts it. Active titles shimmer, failures are red and other
  markers use the primary text color; no trailing status badge is shown.
- The main timeline and interaction surfaces use ordinary stacks to retain
  actual geometry while Markdown, forms and expanded tools change height.
  Deferred parsing/rendering is scoped to hidden tool details. Scroll geometry
  updates are isolated from the content subtree, and a separate observable
  structural projection keeps token/tool-output appends from regrouping every
  historical row. Only status, membership and grouping changes invalidate it.
  Viewport and history-anchor measurements coalesce outside the layout callback;
  identical history positions do not publish another state change. Native scroll
  phase samples supersede queued geometry, and removal cancels pending deliveries.
  Looking up an existing repository model only touches its cache entry; it does
  not re-project historical payloads or subscribe the shell to every row's
  observable fields. Session/New Session pages have equality boundaries that
  isolate sidebar movement while allowing their own observed state to update.
- Consecutive tools/reasoning/artifacts, child Agent calls and reconnect attempts
  are grouped. Rows the connector attributed to an Agent call card
  (`content.parentItemId` on its tool, thinking and text rows) fold under that
  card's group too; the header keeps the call count for nested Agent calls and
  uses a progress count otherwise, with an explicit 查看详情 entry beside the
  disclosure title that never intercepts the existing expand gesture. Groups
  retain the first item's identity while growing, and disclosure state survives
  streaming updates. Items targeted by active notices
  remain individually visible. Hidden items, turn markers, duplicate diff
  artifacts and Claude's interruption/no-response sentinels are filtered like Web.
- The SubAgent panel (medium/large sheet) opens from the capsule or from an
  Agent call card and lists one tab per SubAgent in dispatch order (status dot,
  task name in the title, non-default type badge); completion never reorders
  them, and the title and fixed stats line — status · tool count · duration ·
  tokens, missing counters omitted — follow the selected tab while the body
  scrolls under them. The body shows the dispatch prompt (long prompts fold),
  the card's live tool rows, its thinking rows and, once closed, the
  subagent's final reply; tool and thinking rows reuse the timeline's own
  expanded styles. Everything reads the persisted timeline items, so a relaunch
  or another device restores the panel, and a finished SubAgent stays
  reviewable. SubAgent text never enters the turn's Copy/Share reply.
- Expanded groups align with the timeline without an extra leading inset. Copy
  and Share appear once after each completed reply turn, following Web's grouping
  between user messages. Copy/Share collect that turn's assistant text fragments;
  reasoning, tools and system text stay out. Active/incomplete latest turns have
  no footer; individual entries remain copyable from their context menus. A local
  pending user message already marks the next turn, so its predecessor's footer
  stays visible through HTTP acceptance and the authoritative echo.
- Completed turns with file changes show a single-line file/addition/deletion
  summary above Copy/Share, including turns containing only tools. Its sheet
  lists files and mounts each diff only when expanded. Counts use the latest
  revision of each recorded operation; repeated edits retain chronological
  patches, and an incompletely loaded first turn is identified in the sheet.
  Only the completed footer observes and aggregates file payloads, so streaming
  tokens do not resize the composer or repeatedly insert the review row.
- Git directives become inline badges after Markdown parsing, using Textual
  attachments within the existing stable blocks. Code examples and existing
  links retain their text; copy/export retain the original source. Completed
  directives describe recorded actions, with HTTP(S) PR links opening on tap.
  Appending text preserves completed block identities and equality boundaries.
- Session, New Session and Device use native SwiftUI navigation bars through
  `ChatPageToolbar`. Session titles, Agent/device names and live status share a
  leading-aligned stack in the principal title region, using the space allocated
  between the native buttons instead of a control-sized leading toolbar item.
  `navigationTitle` retains its semantic value. Other pages keep the system
  title/subtitle placements. The floating takeover prompt stays horizontally
  centered; error indicators below the session toolbar align to the leading
  edge. The subtitle stays one line
  tall, including while syncing or idle, so status changes cannot resize the
  timeline. The device ID is used when its name is not yet available. The sidebar
  action uses the same Lucide PanelLeft icon as Web. Toolbar items get their
  spacing, hit regions, glass grouping and scroll-edge treatment from the system;
  on Catalyst, `ChatPageScrollEdge` registers each page's primary scroll view
  with its navigation controller using `setContentScrollView(_:for: .top)` and
  the native soft style. Its marker lives inside the main scroll content so
  nested code panels, the composer and the sidebar cannot be selected instead.
  Outgoing markers yield to newer registrations and clear only their own link.
  There is no custom top `safeAreaBar`, measured header height or compensating
  toast offset. Network failures
  take precedence over cached runtime status; malformed data remains an error
  toast rather than being mislabeled as offline. Sending/waiting/running feedback
  uses a spinner in the existing fixed 32-point timeline tail slot. That slot
  remains the same height when idle, so feedback does not move the scroll anchor.
  There is no first-token thinking label or phantom empty attachment gap.
  A right-hand glass button group contains Files and a details menu; Files opens
  the shared file manager and is not duplicated in the menu. New Session remains
  in the sidebar. The sidebar header contains the wordmark, with no search button,
  search field or hidden session-title filter. The
  phone's left-edge drawer gesture starts within 44 points and still requires
  horizontal intent so vertical timeline scrolling is not intercepted.
  The sliding card uses the host's original horizontal safe-area insets instead
  of deriving new insets from its partly off-screen position. Sidebar movement
  releases the native edge target and suspends queued auto-follow/edge pulls;
  vertical navigation resumes from the reported native scroll phase afterward.
- At regular iPad widths, the native split opens with both columns and keeps the
  sidebar visible when selecting a session, device or New Session. The detail
  remains an active read target while the sidebar sits beside it. Narrow iPad
  windows use `preferredCompactColumn` to show the selected detail; widening
  restores both columns. The balanced style reserves room for the sidebar.
  Explicit split toggles retain smooth animation and respect Reduce Motion.
  The detail uses the native split's proposed width immediately, without a
  frozen width or delayed reflow. The phone drawer shadows only its card
  shape, avoiding an animated compositing layer around the whole conversation.
  `ChatDetailNavigation` creates a NavigationStack inside the phone's moving
  card and applies its stable host insets once, including keyboard space. On
  iPad it reuses the split view's navigation host without another stack or inset.
  Only the custom sidebar hides its navigation bar. The detail shows a native
  bar and removes the duplicate system sidebar toggle in favor of its Lucide
  action. Switching pages does not create a second phone navigation stack.
- Sidebar indicators follow Web's priority and position, on the title's trailing
  side: a green waiting-approval capsule, a native spinner for running/waiting/
  pending, or a green unread dot for an idle session. Opening an unread session
  in the active foreground immediately clears its local unread indicator and
  sends the existing read-receipt API through `V2SessionReadCoordinator`. Requests
  belong to the authenticated services, surviving drawer/selection changes.
  Local seen progress and confirmed `lastReadSeq` merge monotonically across
  dashboard snapshots, independently of `updatedSeq`. A receipt changes read
  progress only, preserving current runtime metadata; older snapshots cannot
  resurrect an already read turn or conceal a newer unseen turn.
  Transient failures retry with backoff only for the visible foreground session.
  Offline/background periods preserve local progress, and new turns received
  while away remain unread. Returning foreground/online retries the visible
  session. Account/server changes invalidate requests and clear the watermarks.
  An unrelated dashboard error does not block this idempotent server operation.
  Dashboard updates drive indicators live. Running sessions sort first in stable
  ID order; other sessions use descending `sortAt`, matching Web within pinned
  and recent sections.
- The plus sheet includes takeover, its consequences and an explicit confirmation.
  Ambiguous writes require refreshing; a successful takeover followed by a failed
  read retains the confirmed write result.
- Read-only sessions also show an interactive glass takeover pill below the
  header, sharing the options sheet's native system Alert. It floats in the same
  overlay layer as error toasts, so metadata arrival or successful takeover does
  not resize the header's safe-area inset. The empty composer says
  “请先接管” until takeover is enabled; existing drafts remain intact. The sidebar
  strokes explicitly use AA's primary foreground color in both appearances.
- Switches use the native switch style with inherited app tint/accent overrides
  cleared. Their shape, thumb, size and animation are supplied by the system.
- Details expose session/device/Agent metadata and JSON export. The server export
  paginates independently of the visible history cache, deduplicates revisions,
  and rejects stalled cursors, cancellation and mismatched sessions. Both exports
  preserve original timeline/notice payloads and identify their source/window.
- Workspace file paths in markers, Markdown links and inline code open a **sheet
  containing the Web preview**. Workspace images also open Web on demand. The
  native directory browser and session links share a scoped, one-use preview
  token flow; native code does not fetch `fs/readText` to render previews. Each
  sheet uses an ephemeral WebKit data store and obtains a fresh token on retry.
  Already displayed content remains visible offline, with device/network status.
  Uploaded session attachments retain their separate attachment download flow.
  References support named files, Windows paths, `:line:column` and `#LlineCcolumn`
  locations. Line/column travel in the preview route fragment, separately from
  the path scoped by the token. The matching Web preview reveals the location in
  Monaco; older Web previews still open the file without positioning the editor.
- Composer image selections use background-downsampled thumbnails. User-message
  attachments appear above the text bubble. Outgoing images are ratio-fitted within
  240×320 points (aspect ratio clamped to 0.6...1.8); out-of-range images fill-crop,
  with tall captures top-aligned. Their 16-point continuous clip has a subtle
  semantic border. Consecutive image attachments use two square columns with 4-point
  gaps and a 240-point width cap; mixed attachment order is retained. Assistant-side
  previews retain their existing 4:3 slot. Only visible remote images request
  thumbnails: uploaded files use the session attachment API; device paths use
  `fs/read` and its binary transfer, honoring the attachment root. Tapping device
  files/images still opens the scoped Web preview sheet. Cached sender preview
  dimensions keep the local placeholder stable through decode, echo and archive
  restore, and the composer measures the original pixel size in the same background
  decode that builds the preview, sending it with uploads (the multipart
  `dimensions` field, aligned to the files order) and first-message inline
  attachments (`width`/`height`). The outgoing bubble sizes from cached sender
  preview dimensions first, then the attachment's server-provided dimensions —
  they take priority over the decoded image when present — and the decoded image
  last; a first-load attachment with none of them uses a 3:4 placeholder until
  its image size is known. A preview written to the cache after a failed load
  re-runs that image's task by itself, and an attachment with a locally cached
  preview loads as soon as it appears instead of waiting for scroll visibility;
  remote fetches still wait for it. The session owns a 16 MiB preview cache and
  bounded attachment metadata; cached previews work offline and account
  invalidation clears them.
- Sending moves the committed draft into a local bubble immediately after uploads
  are ready. Its only pending indicator is a spinner in the bubble's left gutter;
  delivery status never changes text width. Metadata and thumbnails survive
  `clientMessageId` reconciliation, including reordered/sparse server attachments.
  Failed or uncertain writes restore the draft only if the editor is still empty,
  never overwrite a newer draft, and never replay automatically. A compact issue
  icon opens the existing explicit failure/uncertain-delivery actions.
- Session and device-workspace entry points use the same `WorkspaceFilesSheet`.
  Its title remains the device name while navigating directories. A pinned,
  wrapping, selectable path above the list shows the device's resolved absolute
  directory (`fs/list`), with a Copy Path context menu; no local iOS path conversion
  is applied to remote POSIX/Windows paths. The shared sheet owns its detents and
  opens at medium, with expansion to large; individual
  Web previews open large. Long-pressing any directory entry copies its path.
  Files also offer Download (the system export picker) and Open In (the system
  activity sheet). Exports use the full binary transfer, validate its byte count,
  and reject cross-origin credential forwarding. They remain temporary on disk
  until the system sheet closes; cancellation/failure removes partial files.
  The Web preview's own download links, including blob URLs, use `WKDownload`
  and open a system activity sheet on completion.
- Non-inline session/action errors appear below the header in borderless glass
  toasts with horizontal paging, dismissal and explicit refresh where applicable.
  Toasts overlay content without changing the timeline's height. Dismissing one
  never changes connection facts or replays an action. Inline form errors remain
  with their forms.

## New Session and connectivity

`NewSessionModel` owns the account-scoped draft and preparation state. The target
combines a device, configured Agent instance and project. Selecting another device
restores that device's saved project; a deleted/invalid project clears selection
while preserving the draft. The project sheet creates/renames projects and reuses
the existing half-height file browser to choose a directory. Canonical directory
reuse requires confirmation before the endpoint can change the existing name.

The welcome title is the target device's name, and the detail names the Agent
("使用 Codex …"). Both names are underlined and open the target picker. The
directory picker sits directly above the composer, aligned with its leading
edge in both collapsed and expanded states. The
toolbar has a file browser for the selected device and directory and a "…"
menu to change the target or directory, open the device's details page or copy
its ID.

Project creation is available for a known device even when that device is offline
using a typed absolute path; browsing requires it online. Starting a session also
requires phone connectivity, a ready instance, fresh preparation and valid model/
permission selections. Projects are re-read before submission to catch deletion,
device/path changes and stale choices. No draft moves to a replacement target
silently. Reconnection refreshes reads, never replays creation or messages.

The sidebar can switch between projects and all sessions, includes an archive
view, and pages active/archived/project lists independently. Unread/running/approval
indicators reuse the existing presentation. Device projects use server project
records rather than inferring directories from a truncated session list.

Device management and post-pairing setup share `DeviceAgentModel`: configured
instances have native switches and configuration/rename/delete actions; available
types provide quick-add or configuration before add. Every add re-reads inventory,
and an uncertain create/start recovers a matching existing instance on explicit
retry. The pairing sheet offers Desktop installation/login or CLI credentials/
six-digit pairing. Closing it retains account-level waiting; once a watched device
is online, a separate setup sheet offers Agent types. Offline/background pauses
polling, and switching accounts invalidates the queue.

New Session stages a local session and bubble as soon as Send is accepted, clears
the composer and opens that local page. It keeps one clientMessageId through
preflight, creation and binding to the server ID, with returned attachment IDs and
local previews preserved. Existing-session sends similarly display the bubble
before upload. Failure keeps a visible send record and restores an untouched draft;
uncertain sends require checking before explicit retry. New drafts are not erased
by an older completion. The bubble's spinner occupies the left gutter.

Launch restores the last device/New Session/session destination and available disk
content before profile validation. Message history, selected-page state, session
text/attachment drafts, pending delivery records and thumbnails survive termination
within the bounded cache. Pending deliveries reopen as uncertain until confirmed
by an echo; no write is automatically replayed. New Session text/preferences are
saved separately, while unsent New Session attachment picks and interaction form
drafts remain process-local. Network failure shows a nonblocking glass notice;
cached permissions never enable operations. The first run after the memory-only
version needs a successful sync to populate these records. See
[API_ALIGNMENT.md](API_ALIGNMENT.md) for precise cache limits and recovery rules.

## Runtime interaction protocol

`SessionNoticeStore` exposes stable observable notice objects and keeps form drafts
separate from authoritative runtime state. Approval, confirmation, execution-error
and input-request interactions share the same action path. Action IDs, styles,
blocking scope, status and expiry come from the protocol. Known action labels
are localized like Web; extension actions retain their protocol labels.

- Active interactions blocking this session form a vertically paged stack above
  the composer, with a 24-point inset, slightly wider than the collapsed composer. The
  selected item survives new arrivals; removing it selects an adjacent item.
  The collapsed surface is a glass card with fixed title, summary and action
  slots; there is no external response prompt. Details sits to the left of Expand
  and the optional page count inside its aligned header. At default text size the
  preview is 166 points tall. Status uses the summary's second line when needed,
  rather than reserving a separate empty row.
  The stack retains its height across notice
  counts and submission/network hints. Vertical swipes change the selected card.
  Expand opens the selected notice in the full interaction sheet. Operation
  Details opens a sheet with context, editable fields and full diagnostic text.
  Neither entry expands the dock inline.
- Actions reuse `AppGlassButton`: protocol-primary actions are prominent,
  secondary/cancel actions regular, and danger actions destructive. Only the
  selected action shows loading; all actions reject concurrent submissions.
  The compact card prioritizes the primary action and an actual reject action;
  additional choices, including approve-for-session, open in a native “更多” menu
  beside the buttons. Reject and cancel are distinct wire decisions. If the
  protocol offers cancel without reject, the card says “取消本轮”; it never invents
  a reject action or submits cancellation disguised as rejection.
  An incomplete form action opens the editable sheet from the compact card;
  the full form cannot submit until valid.
- Nonblocking interactions are associated with their source/context timeline
  item when present. Unanchored notices appear in the timeline. Ordinary
  notifications do not gain action buttons or block sending.
- Standard `inputRequest` v1 forms support multiple questions, single/multiple
  choices and an explicit Other selector. Single-choice radios remain selected
  on repeated taps, selecting Other clears the single preset, and multiple
  presets can coexist with Other. Deselecting Other removes its payload text.
  Payloads use the protocol's `optionIds` and `customText` structure. All native
  text inputs guard Chinese IME composition; draft objects survive sheet changes.
- Other action schemas support native scalar, enum, enum-array and nested-object
  forms with client validation. Arbitrary JSON Schema extensions are not a
  universal supported surface: unsupported required forms fail closed and direct
  the user to Web rather than submitting an empty or fabricated payload.
- `open`/`failed` can accept an explicit response. `responding`,
  `response_accepted` and `resolving` stay visible without enabling duplicate
  submissions. Terminal/expired notices cannot be answered.
- HTTP acceptance does not close the notice. Runtime state confirms completion.
  A later refresh failure cannot turn an accepted action into a retryable write.
  Ambiguous writes require review; drafts survive disconnection and status
  revisions, and reset when the form definition changes.
- `waiting_approval` is a runtime/session state, as well as a timeline status.
  Metadata decoding accepts it and preserves unknown future state values as
  `.unknown`. A decoding failure is an invalid response, never a network outage;
  errors identify the event and field without exposing payload contents. Cards
  distinguish phone offline, device offline and state validation errors.

## Login lifecycle

After the user selects a local server (address entry or QR confirmation), a real
native connection to that target requests local-network access before the OAuth
browser opens. It waits through the system prompt, supports cancellation, and
offers Settings when access is denied. It does not broadcast discovery traffic.
Authentication URL sessions wait for connectivity. `Info.plist` registers the
OAuth callback as a URL-types array and declares scoped local-network ATS rules.

OAuth attempts own their presentation window and continuation. Browser dismissal,
failure to start, task cancellation and late duplicate callbacks settle the
attempt exactly once. The redirect target, state and authorization-code fields
are validated before token exchange, and the profile is verified before saving
credentials. Cancelling the browser remains a retryable login outcome rather
than a “server unavailable” alert.

## Device overview, configuration and settings

The device page uses the same safe-area ownership as chat: the phone drawer
provides its insets, while an iPad split view owns the native safe area. The
centered content contains configured Agents and a Projects/Sessions switch.
Projects use canonical project IDs, with files, new-session, rename, pin,
archive and delete actions. Session rows reuse the sidebar's unread/running/
approval presentation and support project filtering, paging and batch actions.

Runtime configuration follows Web's JSON Schema and UI metadata. Gateway,
environment variables and custom models/efforts have structured editors.
Environment values preserve the distinction between an empty string and an
unset (`null`) override. Draft row identities survive edits, incomplete input
remains editable, field validation precedes saving, and reconnects do not replace
the draft. Reset preserves named-instance requirements, and leaving an edited
form offers to discard the draft. Switches use the native green switch style.

Settings opens at the large detent. Account, App, Workspace and About are grouped
native rows, with separate editors for nickname, email, avatar and password.
Appearance offers System/Light/Dark; language follows iOS per-app preferences
and links to the app's system settings. Browse sheets share a trailing glass
close button; pushed browse pages keep the native back button. Editors share
leading Cancel and trailing Save/Add with a stable loading indicator. The file
browser and composer options retain their medium/large detents.

All app-owned copy lives in English/Simplified Chinese string catalogs, including
errors, accessibility labels and system permission explanations. Localize strings
before passing them through a `String`-typed wrapper; a plain Swift `String`
does not get SwiftUI's literal localization automatically. Interpolate complete
phrases rather than concatenating translated fragments. Runtime metadata keys
reuse Web's translations; user text, tool output and protocol identifiers are
kept intact. English count phrases have plural variants.

App icons use native template SVG assets generated from the installed Web Lucide
package. `AppSymbol` and `AppFileSymbol` centralize action and file-type mappings;
native controls such as switches, progress indicators and system pickers retain
their platform drawing. Regenerate or verify the committed vectors after changing
`ios/Design/Symbols.json` or updating Web's Lucide dependency:

```sh
node ios/scripts/sync-symbols.mjs
node ios/scripts/sync-symbols.mjs --check
```

The generator also accepts a Web `node_modules` directory as its first argument
when the iOS worktree has no Web dependencies. It never downloads a new package.
The bundled Lucide license is visible under Settings → About.

## Release resources

The app's `Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` declares required-reason API use:

| API category | Reason | Use in this client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User defaults | `CA92.1` | App-local account, appearance and workspace preferences. |
| System boot time | `35F9.1` | Elapsed time for chat presentation and glyph reveal. |
| File timestamps | `C617.1` | Eviction ordering for session files in the app's cache. |

The vendored Textual package has its own manifest for its app-local logging
preference (`CA92.1`), copied through SwiftPM resources. The archived app must
contain `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` at its root and the separate Textual resource
bundle manifest. These reasons follow Apple's
[required-reason API declarations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/app-privacy-configuration/nsprivacyaccessedapitypes/nsprivacyaccessedapitype).

Deleting an Agent configuration permanently deletes its associated sessions,
history and attachments on the current v2 backend. Both the source fallback and
English/Chinese confirmation copy state this effect. Shared DSH permission labels
come from the Web catalog; the compiled localization probe checks these strings
and the destructive confirmation, including interpolation of the Agent name.

### Release validation on 2026-09-08

Candidate `2.0.0 (7)` at `53e39431`, minimum iOS 26.5:

- 226 client-core tests across 27 suites pass, including the regenerated backend
  fixtures and creation requests with the current empty `runtimeOptions` default.
- Backend fixture consistency and the four Web-copy conversion tests pass.
- All 862 English/Chinese catalog entries and 375 shared Web messages pass the
  localization check. All 763 compiler-extracted keys from 214 active Swift files
  are covered, including the Git addition/deletion counts.
- A complete unsigned Release archive succeeds with Xcode 27.0 (`27A5237l`).
  Both privacy manifests are present in their expected bundles and match the
  committed sources. All 58 compiled localization checks pass; the archived
  resources also contain both Git count strings and omit the old deletion promise.
- The coverage checker accepts both build and archive intermediate layouts,
  ignores generated/package sources and still rejects empty DerivedData.

Reproduce the archive and compiled resource checks without starting the app:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild \
  -project 'ios/Agents Anywhere/Agents Anywhere.xcodeproj' \
  -scheme 'Agents Anywhere' -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -derivedDataPath ios/.build/release \
  -archivePath ios/.build/AgentsAnywhere.xcarchive \
  -onlyUsePackageVersionsFromResolvedFile -jobs 4 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO archive
uv run --no-project python ios/scripts/check-localization.py --derived-data ios/.build/release
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer swift \
  ios/Tests/LocalizationProbe.swift \
  'ios/.build/AgentsAnywhere.xcarchive/Products/Applications/Agents Anywhere.app'
```

The beta compiler reports Swift isolation warnings during the successful build.
Distribution signing, App Store Connect validation/upload and the manual device
checks below remain to be performed. Cloud sign-in awaits the v2 backend
deployment; this preparation does not change its endpoint or login flow.

## Verified checks

Verified on 2026-09-06, without starting a server or simulator:

- 177 headless Swift tests across 23 suites pass against production client-core
  sources. They cover API contracts, recovery/cache races, uncertain delivery,
  batched presentation, echo handoff, target preparation, preference scope, schema
  payloads and interaction lifecycle/IME guards. Session-detail checks cover
  tool/diff parsing, grouping identity, file routing, export pagination/cancellation,
  OAuth callback validation, local-server classification and waiting-approval
  metadata through an actual repository connection and response. Navigation
  cases cover actual tail visibility despite conflicting geometry, out-of-order
  visibility callbacks, opening before tail measurement, manual/explicit returns,
  animation completion ordering, drawer occlusion, interaction changes and both
  history edges. Layout regression cases replay alternating intrinsic text widths
  under one column proposal, transient short/empty fragments, minimum/ideal probes
  and immediate narrow/wide reflow. Header status tests distinguish real offline
  facts from stale activity, syncing and invalid responses. Sidebar status priority/order and compact approval
  grouping are checked against the Web and runtime contracts. Read receipt tests
  exercise the production API, immediate local read state, rapid navigation,
  equal-revision snapshots, delayed acknowledgements, per-turn coalescing,
  connectivity/lifecycle recovery and account invalidation.
  Sidebar tests cover regular/compact selection and resize behavior, and confirm
  cached model lookup does not subscribe its caller to historical row payloads.
  Phone interaction tests cover the settled sidebar, suspended page input during
  open/close springs and interrupted pans, and reactivation after closing.
  Opening/history tests cover measured offset retention, scroll-independent
  presentation and optimistic echo handoff, realtime updates during opening,
  pulls, cancellation, opening without fetching earlier user messages, the
  instant opening return and cached-snapshot presentation before the refresh
  completes.
  Attachment/delivery tests cover sparse/reordered echoes, bounded caches, FS
  thumbnail reads, offline preview reuse and preserving a newer identical draft.
  Configuration tests exercise the real Codex schema, Gateway validation,
  environment unset/empty values, model/effort validation, reset and draft state.
- The catalog check covers every compiler-extracted app string, English/Chinese
  translation completeness, interpolation argument types/order, plural rules,
  permission dialogs and shared Web copy, including runtime metadata. The reviewed
  mappings in `scripts/web-copy-map.json` reuse `web-next/messages/en.json` and
  `zh-CN.json`; `scripts/web_copy.py --write` updates those catalog entries without
  replacing native-only offline, permissions, or unconfirmed-write messages.
  Named Web arguments retain Swift argument positions, and ICU counts become
  native plural variations. A standalone Foundation
  probe reads compiled `.lproj` files and checks translations, plural counts
  0/1/2, reordered arguments and both permission descriptions.
- The Python backend contract fixture exporter reports that fixtures are current.
- `Tests/DrawerLayoutProbe.swift` uses the real SwiftUI `ImageRenderer` on macOS,
  without a window or simulator. Across 44 renders at 2x/3x with fractional pan
  positions, the old geometry-group/offset control changes its reported origin;
  the new transform retains origin zero and size 402x200 while rendered images
  move. It also checks the actual SwiftUI Path used by the close layer's
  `contentShape`: sidebar points are excluded and visible-card points included
  at fractional reveal widths. These are layout and hit-region checks, not an
  end-to-end touch dispatch test; on-device interaction still needs the manual
  drawer checks below.
- `Tests/ViewModelLifetimeProbe.swift` uses an offscreen SwiftUI host to compare
  eager State initialization with the lazy model holder. Across 120 parent
  updates the control creates 121 models, the holder creates one, and its page
  task does not restart. Observable updates still reach the page and a changed
  page identity creates a fresh model. The 600-record cache test confirms that
  history projection waits for preparation and does not request history again.
- `scripts/probe-drawer-updates.py` compiles the actual drawer with only its
  progress driver replaced in a temporary copy. Across 240 synthetic pan samples
  the header/sidebar/detail factories do no additional work; a destination
  change still rebuilds the page. This validates the update boundary, not device
  frame rate or real gesture dispatch.
- The complete unsigned iOS Debug target builds for `generic/platform=iOS`, using
  the checked-in package resolutions and the Xcode beta toolchain. The app's
  existing iOS 26.5 deployment target remains unchanged.

## Manual Xcode checks

Open `ios/Agents Anywhere/Agents Anywhere.xcodeproj`, choose the `Agents Anywhere`
scheme and the intended signing team/device. Rendering, the system pickers, actual
keyboard layout and real mobile-network behavior still need manual validation:

1. Check AA colors in light/dark mode and the compact/expanded composer, including
   focus with no text, whitespace-only text, attachments and large Dynamic Type.
2. With a Chinese keyboard, select candidates, tap Send during composition, use
   Return for newlines and Command-Return on a hardware keyboard. Paste long text
   and verify internal scrolling and keyboard safe areas.
3. Open Photos and Files from the options sheet, cancel and reopen, then send
   attachments. Check model/permission secondary pages and capability changes.
4. Stream the first reply and another reply with Markdown, code and tables. Check
   glyph reveal, stable message handoff, tail following and manual scroll-away.
5. Select another device and Agent, cancel halfway, then switch back. Check that
   the workspace and selections belong to the chosen target.
6. Disconnect the phone network, disconnect the target device and background the
   app during preparation/streaming. Restore connectivity and confirm drafts and
   selection remain, reads recover and writes are not replayed.
7. Exercise approval, confirmation, execution-error and multi-question input
   requests, including concurrent notices, IME input, expiry, failures and an
   accepted response followed by temporary disconnection.
8. Check single-line markers, nested Agent groups, command/output copying and
   file-change diffs. Open workspace paths and images from Markdown and the file
   browser; refresh previews after disconnection and close/reopen a sheet.
9. Swipe approval cards vertically, including long forms; cards should be slightly
   wider than the collapsed composer, with Details to the left of Expand on the
   same line. Accept the final request and check the return after the dock closes.
   Swipe multiple top errors horizontally and
   dismiss them without changing the conversation's scroll position. Check
   Approve/Reject, the native More menu, and a runtime offering only Approve/Cancel.
10. Test first-use local-network permission (allow and deny), cancelling OAuth,
    an invalid/expired callback and starting login again. Inspect the native
    header edge effect over long titles and bright content in both appearances.
11. Reach the actual bottom with and without the keyboard/approval dock; the
    return pill should hide near the bottom and while scrolling. Stop farther up
    and verify it returns without snapping back. At each history edge, release
    a fresh pull to load one page; scroll during loading to cancel restoration.
12. Open the sidebar during running, approval and idle-unread states. Open an
    unread session and immediately reopen the sidebar or choose another session.
    Its unread dot should clear immediately and stay cleared after the request
    and dashboard update. New turns received while away should become unread.
    Switch apps and return, and reconnect after going offline; verify read
    synchronization and live status changes without reopening the app.
13. On iPad, start at regular width and select several sessions, devices and New
    Session; the sidebar should remain alongside the detail. Check the sidebar
    header and native detail navigation bar against the status bar, including
    long titles, large text, light/dark mode and live syncing feedback. Resize to a
    narrow window, select a session, reopen the sidebar and widen again. With a
    long Markdown history, toggle the sidebar and check responsiveness, retained
    reading position and continued streaming while the detail remains visible.
14. Open long, short and running sessions: a cold load's spinner appears at
    once, loading starts after the sidebar animation, and the loaded content
    lands instantly at the bottom; a previously cached session opens with no
    spinner and no scroll animation. Switch sessions rapidly during drawer motion.
    At the bottom of a long session, slowly open/close the iPhone drawer and leave
    it open; check stable footer spacing and no repeated vertical corrections.
    Check the two gesture directions separately, especially revealing the session
    from an already open drawer. Set the `AA_CHAT_LAYOUT_TRACE=1` launch environment
    variable to enable debug geometry diagnostics; normal debug runs do not
    install per-row/per-block observers. Enabled builds log vertical changes during
    drawer navigation under OSLog category `drawer-layout`: content/viewport height
    and offset distinguish reflow or scrolling from a drawing-only flash. These
    logs contain no message text and do not require a diagnostics overlay.
    `Drawer component` lines narrow a content-size change to a group, row,
    Copy/Share footer, or Markdown block's final `layout` size. Header, composer,
    interaction dock and constant tail-spacer sizes are traced as well. Intrinsic
    text widths no longer write to View state or generate reserved/natural trace
    pairs. Membership/status changes are reported separately from size changes
    so a 48-point footer and a paragraph reflow cannot be mistaken for each other.
    Repeat while reading in the middle and while streaming. Expand/collapse the
    composer, show/dismiss the keyboard and respond to approval cards; check the
    bottom margin is applied once and that a manual upward scroll is respected.
    The column width should remain constant during fractional drawer movement;
    check both the live drag and spring settlement, then tap the visible card to
    close the drawer and verify normal text selection, scrolling and composer taps.
    With the phone drawer fully open, select several sessions, a device and the
    account button; each sidebar action must receive its own tap. Only tapping
    the exposed main-card strip closes the drawer without changing selection.
    Check Agent/device names and syncing/offline feedback in the header, and the fixed-height sending/running footer.
    Sync completion and takeover must not move the viewport. Resize the iPad
    split and change Dynamic Type in both directions; blocks should rewrap with
    no reservation from the previous font/column width. Load older pages by tap/pull and check the spinner, retained
    reading offset and the final-page marker. Send images and documents, check
    composer thumbnails, the bubble's left spinner and unchanged preview/text
    geometry after echoes. Read a device-path image online, then reopen it offline
    from cache. Verify the previous completed reply's Copy/Share stays available.
15. Open Files from the session's top-right folder button and from a device's
    workspace. Both should open the same medium sheet, show the device name as
    the navigation title and keep the current full path above the list. Enter
    subdirectories and go back; long POSIX/Windows paths must wrap without
    truncation and support Copy Path. Check file preview/download/open-in actions.
    The sidebar has no search control, and the session's More menu has no second
    Files entry. New Session remains available at the bottom of the sidebar.

16. Load a session, type a draft, background/terminate the app, disconnect the
    network and reopen. It should show the same page and cached messages without
    waiting for the server or presenting a blocking sheet. Restore connectivity
    and confirm background synchronization without clearing/scroll-resetting the
    visible content. Repeat on a device page and New Session, then sign out and
    verify that another account/server cannot see the former cache.
17. Create/select a project, check canonical directory reuse confirmation, change
    device/Agent, and delete the selected project from another client before Send.
    Load more than 100 sessions, open project/archived pages, and refresh while a
    page request is pending. Restore and archive without losing cached pages.
18. Use Desktop and CLI pairing; close the form while the CLI is offline, then
    connect it and add/configure an Agent in the resulting sheet. Interrupt one
    add/start request and retry after refreshing: it should reuse the instance.
19. Send a photo over a slow connection and create a first session with attachments.
    Check immediate local navigation/bubble/thumbnail, the left spinner, unchanged
    client message identity after confirmation, and failure editing/retry. Kill
    the app during a send: reopen must retain an uncertain record without sending
    again. Verify that the earlier completed reply keeps Copy/Share throughout.
