/**
 * Contract between the Electron main process (UI shell) and the Desktop backend
 * process.
 *
 * The backend is an independent Node process (`child_process.fork` with
 * `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`) that owns the Connector, its logs, the Desktop
 * settings and local binding stores, and the shared machine-state record. It
 * never touches the window, so a blocked or crashed backend cannot freeze the
 * user interface.
 *
 * Two channels exist on purpose:
 *
 * - Loopback HTTP + SSE carries every renderer-facing operation. The main
 *   process re-exposes it under `/desktop-api` on the app origin, so the
 *   renderer keeps talking to one same-origin endpoint and never sees a port,
 *   a token, or an IPC channel.
 * - The `fork()` IPC channel carries process lifecycle only (ready, shutdown)
 *   plus `netFetch`, which must run in Electron Main because it is the only
 *   place that gets Chromium's proxy and certificate handling.
