# Web Behavior Target

Status: draft.

This document defines how Web should consume Agent Runtime Protocol v1.

## Principles

- Web must not infer behavior from runtime names.
- Web must not maintain server catalog caches as source of truth.
- Web may remember the user's most recent model/permission selection locally for new sessions only.
- Message sending must not carry model/permission selection ids for existing sessions.
- Commands are not messages.

## Device runtime presentation

Runtime types and runtime instances carry different facts; Web must not mix them.

- A runtime type in the device list means "this connector supports this type". It
  carries no availability and no error state, so it is never rendered with a
  warning or error colour. Whether the local program is running is not part of
  the type list.
- Only a configured instance has availability and error states. Availability
  means "configured and running". A configured instance that was never started
  is a neutral state, not a failure.
- The connector decides real usability when the user configures or starts an
  instance (`runtime.validateConfig` / `runtime.start`), never during
  `runtime.discover`. A failed configuration or start records its reason on the
  instance, and Web renders that reason on the instance.
- `runtime_unavailable`, `runtime_not_started`, `runtime_not_configured` and
  `connector_offline` mean "not usable yet" and are rendered as a warning with
  the connector's reason, not as a fault.
- `starting` and `stopping` are real states. Web shows the transition instead of
  jumping from stopped straight to running.
- `instancePolicy` and `maxInstances` limit simultaneously running instances.
  Saved configurations do not hide an otherwise addable runtime type. The
  Connector checks capacity when starting, and Server returns HTTP 409 with
  `runtime_conflict` when the limit is reached. Stopping an instance releases
  its running slot without deleting its configuration.

## New session

Flow:

```text
Open new session
  -> read runtime model catalog
  -> read runtime permission catalog
  -> preselect local recent selection if still present and enabled
  -> otherwise choose first enabled option
  -> create_and_start with selections + first message
```

There is no runtime default in the protocol. Defaulting is a frontend behavior.

Blank new session creation is not supported in the first target.

## Existing session

Initial load:

```text
Load session snapshot
  -> read SessionMeta
  -> read SessionState
  -> read SessionTimeline
  -> read SessionNotice
  -> render timeline/notices
```

Opening selectors:

```text
Open model selector
  -> live read runtime model catalog

Open permission selector
  -> live read runtime permission catalog
```

Changing selectors:

```text
User chooses selection
  -> PATCH session runtime selection
  -> runtime accepts or rejects
  -> Web may update optimistically
  -> Web reconciles from runtime.state.updated or GET /runtime/state
```

The runtime may also update selections without direct user action. Web must
treat RuntimeLive state updates as authoritative.

## Message composer

For existing sessions:

```text
POST /sessions/{id}/runtime/messages
```

Payload should include:

- content
- attachments
- client message id

Payload must not include:

- model selection id
- permission selection id

## Commands

When the input begins with `/`, Web should list commands by live RPC:

```text
GET /sessions/{id}/runtime/commands
```

The frontend handles:

- filtering
- fuzzy matching
- ranking
- keyboard navigation
- completion
- displaying disabled reason

The protocol does not include `autocomplete`.

Executing a command:

```text
POST /sessions/{id}/runtime/commands
```

Command execution returns a normal RPC result. If the runtime changes timeline, state, selection, or notices, those changes arrive through normal runtime events.

If command catalog lookup or execution fails, Web must show an error and must not send the `/xxx` input as a normal message.

Selecting a command with arguments inserts an editable draft; explicit submission
preserves the full `raw` input. A command's `metadata.ui` selects native execution
or a supported model/reasoning/permission selector. Commands without that metadata
retain legacy single-line execution in idle/error states. Multiline input is
allowed only when advertised. Attachments stay in the draft.

Web distinguishes accepted, completed and unknown execution results, displays
native text and treats `ok: false` as a failure even with HTTP 200. Failures and
uncertain outcomes preserve input; unknown outcomes are never retried
automatically. Late responses cannot clear newer drafts or change another
session, including when the user leaves and revisits the original session.

Refetch the catalog on session changes, command-menu reopening, reconnect,
runtime status/availability changes and `session.commands` catalog revision
changes. Hide a previous session's catalog immediately during navigation. Command
availability still requires effective capabilities, an online writable session
and the command's native status restrictions.

## Session RuntimeLive UI

Web should render busy/blocking labels from RuntimeLive state. Action
availability, including interrupt and steer, comes from session-scoped effective
capabilities. Timeline and notices explain what is happening but must not
replace RuntimeLive state or effective capability.
- selections
- status reason
- error
- metadata

It does not include:

- active turn id
- command list
- catalog data
- timeline items

## Snapshot and recovery

Snapshot is for initial load and explicit recovery, not periodic refresh. Normal updates should flow through WebSocket/event recovery.

Sequence gaps should not force snapshot unless the server explicitly marks recovery as impossible. Timeline items are upsert-only; hiding replaces deletion.
