# Realtime API

Status: proposal and current-behavior map.

Agents Anywhere uses realtime channels for three different lifecycles:

- session detail updates;
- dashboard connector/session list updates;
- connector RPC/ingest presence;
- terminal streams.

Connector channel endpoint names stay stable. Session and dashboard realtime
semantics should be tightened around the new session model:

```text
SessionMeta and SessionTimeline are durable Server facts.
Runtime state, notices, catalogs, capabilities, commands, and selections are
non-durable RuntimeLive facts.
```

## Session realtime

Primary realtime channel:

```text
WS /api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}/ws?ticket=...
```

Recovery endpoint:

```text
GET /api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}/events?after=seq:123
```

Ticket endpoint:

```text
POST /api/v2/ws-ticket
```

### Intended lifecycle

```text
GET /sessions/{sessionId}/snapshot
  -> reads durable meta/timeline from Server and RuntimeLive facts from runtime RPC
  -> receive durable eventCursor
POST /ws-ticket
  -> session scope ticket
WS /sessions/{sessionId}/ws?ticket=...
  -> receive session.subscribed
  -> receive incremental events
GET /sessions/{sessionId}/events?after=seq:...
  -> post-subscription cursor reconciliation and reconnect recovery
```

`/events` is not snapshot polling. It is a cursor recovery API. If WebSocket is healthy, the client should not call `/events` on a fixed interval.

### Target event types

```text
session.subscribed
session.meta.updated
timeline.item_created
timeline.item_updated
timeline.snapshot
runtime.state.updated
runtime.notice.snapshot
runtime.notice.updated
runtime.capability.updated
runtime.catalog.updated
runtime.refetch_required
session.refetch_required
```

Removed compatibility event types:

- `session.status_changed`
- `notice.created`
- `notice.updated`
- `notice.snapshot`
- embedded `effectiveCapabilities` aliases in session realtime events

Use `runtime.state.updated`, `runtime.capability.updated`,
`runtime.notice.updated`, and `runtime.notice.snapshot` for live Runtime facts.

### Recovery rules

- Event cursor format is `seq:{number}`.
- Timeline items are upsert-only.
- A sequence gap does not automatically require snapshot.
- Server returns `snapshotRequired=true` only when durable meta/timeline
  recovery is explicitly impossible.
- Client pulls snapshot only for initial load or `snapshotRequired=true`.
- Runtime state and catalogs are not recovered from Server DB. After reconnect,
  Web calls the relevant runtime live endpoint if it needs current state or
  catalogs.
- Runtime notices are recovered when Server has a sequence-backed projection.
  Session meta and the latest persisted effective capability projection are
  also returned when recovery starts at the current cursor, because presence
  and capabilities can change without advancing the durable session sequence.
  When the connector is online, Web reads the live session capability endpoint
  after recovery and keeps that Runtime result authoritative.
- `runtime.capability.updated` carries effective capabilities. On a session
  WebSocket, it is session-scoped and controls current session actions. On a
  dashboard/runtime WebSocket, it is runtime-scoped and controls setup,
  create-session, catalog, and feature entry points.
- Web should not derive action availability from `runtime.state.updated` when a
  matching effective capability exists.

## Dashboard realtime

Primary realtime channel:

```text
WS /api/v2/dashboard/ws?ticket=...
```

Removed legacy SSE:

```text
GET /api/v2/sessions/events/dashboard?token=...
```

Do not add new clients for this route. Dashboard lifecycle updates use
`/dashboard/ws`.

The Web client should prefer dashboard WebSocket and stop fixed-interval polling of:

```text
GET /api/v2/connectors
GET /api/v2/projects
GET /api/v2/sessions/list
```

### Current dashboard behavior

The current dashboard WebSocket sends:

```text
dashboard.snapshot
```

on connect, and sends another full snapshot when a debounced `dashboard.changed` invalidation arrives.

Each snapshot contains the complete owned project and session metadata inventories,
including both active and archived sessions. `sessionPages` reports no more pages.
Web and iOS group, filter and sort these sessions locally. Expanding a project,
switching a device filter or opening archives does not fetch another session list.
An explicit HTTP refresh reads `/projects` and `/sessions/list` once each, alongside
the connector list; it does not issue a request for every project or archive state.

Project mutations refresh the shared project list. A session with an unknown or
missing project binding also triggers a shared project refresh and remains visible
under ungrouped sessions. Clients coalesce concurrent project reads and remember
unresolved bindings, so every message on an unassigned session does not cause a new
request. A failed read can retry after a later update. Newer push or mutation data
takes precedence over an earlier HTTP read.

This is acceptable as a near-term replacement for polling. If full snapshots become too heavy, the next step is delta events:

```text
connector.created
connector.updated
connector.deleted
connector.presence.updated
runtime.updated
session.created
session.meta.updated
session.state.updated
session.archived
```

Do not implement delta dashboard events until the snapshot WebSocket path is stable.

## Connector realtime

Stable connector channel:

```text
WS /api/v2/connector/ws
```

Stable connector HTTP endpoints:

```text
POST /api/v2/connector/auth
POST /api/v2/connector/ingest
```

These endpoint names should not change as part of the runtime protocol refactor.

### Connector runtime RPC methods

The runtime protocol refactor evolves payload semantics behind
`WS /api/v2/connector/ws`. Runtime configuration is provider-managed and
read-only once a runtime instance is running:

```text
runtime.discover
runtime.configSchema
runtime.config
runtime.validateConfig
runtime.start
runtime.stop
runtime.modelCatalog
runtime.permissionCatalog
session.discover
session.create
session.sync
session.state
session.selections.update
session.commands
session.command.execute
interaction.respond
turn.start
turn.steer
turn.interrupt
```

`runtime.configSchema` performs a live provider read for UI/CLI configuration
forms. `runtime.config` returns saved raw values when the runtime is stopped,
and the running runtime's read-only effective `RuntimeConfig` projection when
it is running. Config mutation still flows through `runtime.validateConfig` and
`runtime.start`; running `AgentRuntime` instances do not accept direct config
updates.

`runtime.discover` includes runtime-native capability inputs. They are not the
primary frontend contract. The frontend contract is effective capability:

```text
GET /connectors/{connectorId}/runtimes/{runtime}/capabilities
GET /sessions/{sessionId}/runtime/capabilities
runtime.capability.updated
```

The Server may apply authorization, takeover, connector reachability, and
feature policy. It must not infer runtime-owned action availability from
durable session data.

Runtime host live events are sent as connector WebSocket notifications on
`WS /api/v2/connector/ws`. `POST /api/v2/connector/ingest` is reserved for
explicit bulk sync and disconnected WebSocket fallback; it must still compute
changed timeline items and publish session WebSocket events for frontend
convergence.

`POST /api/v2/connector/ingest` isolates notification failures inside a batch.
One malformed or conflicting notification must not produce HTTP 500 or prevent
later notifications in the same request from being applied. The response
includes:

```json
{
  "accepted": 2,
  "rejected": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "method": "timeline.itemUpsert",
      "code": "notification_failed",
      "message": "...",
      "errorType": "ValidationError"
    }
  ],
  "serverTime": "..."
}
```

`accepted` counts successfully applied notifications. `rejected` reports
per-notification failures using the original zero-based batch index. Every
notification-level failure is isolated to its own entry: intentionally
unsupported or invalid notifications are reported through `rejected` with a
dedicated `code` (for example `unsupported_timeline_marker`,
`unsupported_notification`, `unsupported_legacy_selection_fields`,
`invalid_runtime_catalog`), and unexpected processing failures are reported
through `rejected` instead of surfacing as HTTP 500. A single violating
notification never fails the whole batch. HTTP 400 is reserved for
request-level failures where the batch itself cannot be parsed or trusted;
structurally invalid request bodies are rejected by request validation before
any notification is applied.

The target semantic connector notification methods are:

```text
session.meta.upsert
timeline.sync
timeline.itemUpsert
runtime.state.updated
runtime.notice.snapshot
runtime.notice.updated
runtime.capability.updated
runtime.catalog.updated
runtime.error
```

Compatibility connector notification names may remain during migration:

```text
session.state.updated
notice.upsert
protocol.capabilitiesUpdated
```

The Server should translate compatibility names into RuntimeLive events without
treating them as durable session truth.

The connector application layer bridges `RuntimeHostClient` calls to these
server-facing notification payloads. Runtime adapters should never call
connector HTTP/WS transports directly.

## Terminal realtime

Current terminal channels include:

```text
WS /api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}/terminals/{terminalId}/stream
WS /api/v2/connectors/{connectorId}/terminals/{terminalId}/stream
WS /api/v2/connectors/{connectorId}/terminals-v2/{terminalId}/stream
WS /api/v2/connector/terminals/{terminalId}/relay
```

Terminal APIs are local capability APIs, not Agent Runtime Protocol session APIs. They can be cleaned up later as a separate local-capabilities interface pass.

Do not block the runtime protocol migration on terminal endpoint consolidation.
